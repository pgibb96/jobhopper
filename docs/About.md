## About JobHopper

Many workers have limited outside options for career and wage progression outside their current occupations. The quality of outside options matter for workersâ€™ wages but limited data exists to provide guidance and training to workers on occupational mobility and outside-options (Monopsony and Outside Options. Schubert, Stansbury, and Taska. Harvard University, March 2020). The problem that we are tryingto solve is to provide better insight than standard data sets for improving occupational mobility options, improving worker wages, and improving policies related to investments and training.
