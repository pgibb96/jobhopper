# Overview
In order to make a start on the project, we picked the career coach. This page will be a single page with three columns where the user moves left to right with this as a goal/path:
 * What are you now? (Enter SOC Code/Text)
 * What can you be? Provide The top 5 transitioned position destinations
 * How can you get there? (education/skills/wage employment-median salary)

As part of discussion on 8/4/2020, the team agreed to the following:
1. Two Tier application (Python/Django)
This application will serve both the static html/js/css
This application will also serve both the API requests needed to translate the sql database to json.

2. DB Tier will be built using SQLLite.
https://www.sqlite.org/index.html
https://sqlitebrowser.org/

Code developed here may be migrated later to another sql-based database like mysql or postgres.

# Future
In the future, we may migrate away from sqlite and move to a more serious framework related to the application UI like React as we move from v0 to v1.
