### Questions That JobHopper Will Be Trying To Answer

- [ ] How might we enable citizens to have better information about the career paths that they could move into from their current job?
- [ ] How can citizens weigh and negotiate options for a new career path?
- [ ] How might we equip policymakers with labor market data?
- [ ] How might we identify where the labor market is headed and what skills and abilities are needed in the new jobs?
- [ ] How might we equip workforce development systems with job transfer data to understand regional trends in employee movements?

1. occupational trends in their national, regional, or local labor market
2. what skills and abilities their area has, and what it might need in the future
3. how their local labor market might respond to positive or negative shocks
